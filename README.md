# Harmony API!!

Harmony API is a simple server allowing you to query/control a local [Harmony
Home Hub](http://myharmony.com/products/detail/home-hub/) over HTTP or MQTT.

With HTTP, you can simply turn your devices on and off and check their status
with simple HTTP requests from almost any other project.

With MQTT, you can easily monitor the state of your devices as well as switch
the current activity of your whole hub. This makes it super easy to integrate
into your existing home automation setup.


## Features

* List activities.
* Get current status, including if everything is off, or what the current activity is.
* Turn everything off.
* Start a specific activity.

## Setup

    script/bootstrap

## Settings

Harmony API discovers your hub automatically. You can optionally add your MQTT
broker's host to connect to it.

```json
{
  "mqtt_host": "192.168.1.106"
}
```

## Running It
Get up and running immediately with `script/server`.

Harmony API will run on port `8282` by default. Use the `PORT` environment
variable to use your own port.

### Forever
harmony-api has support for [Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever). It uses
`launchd` on OS X to kick it off so that it starts on boot. There is no `init.d`
other Linux support of this type. Pull requests would be welcome for this though.

### Development
You can simply run it by calling `script/server`. This will run it in development
mode with logging to standard out.

### Install as Service on OS X

    script/install

## Logging

Harmony API logs all of its requests. In `production`, it logs to a file at `log/logs.log`.
In `development` mode, it just logs to stdout.

## Development

Launch the app via `script/server` to run it in the development environment.

## MQTT Docs

harmony-api can report its state changes to your MQTT broker. Just add your
config file in `/etc/opt/harmony-api/config.json` to add your MQTT host.

harmony-api publishes topics with the namespace of: `harmony-api`.

### State Topics

When the state changes on your harmony hub, state topics will be immediately
broadcasted over your broker. There's quite a few topics that are broadcasted.

Here's a list:

#### Current State

This topic describes the current power state. Message is `on` or `off`.

`harmony-api/state` `on`

#### Current Activity

This topic describes what the current activity of the hub is. The message is
the slug of an activity name.

`harmony-api/current_activity` `watch-tv`

#### Activity States

These topics describe the state of each activity that the hub has. The message
is `on` or `off`. There will a topic for every activity on your hub.

`harmony-api/activities/watch-tv/state` `off`  
`harmony-api/activities/watch-apple-tv/state` `on`  
`harmony-api/activities/play-xbox-one/state` `off`  


### Command Topics

You can also command harmony-api to change activities by publishing topics.
harmony-api listens to this topic and will change to the activity when it sees
it.

Just provide the slug of the activity you want to switch to and `on` as the
message. Any use of this topic with the message `off` will turn everything off.

`harmony-api/activities/watch-tv/command` `on`  


## HTTP API Docs

This is a quick overview of the service. Read [app.js](app.js) if you need more
info.

:warning: These endpoints may not be stable as this project moves fast towards
`1.0.0`.

### Resources

Here's a list of resources that may be returned in a response.

#### Activity Resource

The Activity resource returns all the information you really need for an
Activity set up in your Harmony Hub.

```json
{
  "id": "15233552",
  "slug": "watch-tv",
  "label": "Watch TV",
  "isAVActivity": true
}
```

#### Status Resource

The Status resource returns the current state of your Harmony Hub.

```json
{
  "off": false,
  "current_activity": {
    "id": "15233552",
    "slug": "watch-tv",
    "label": "Watch TV",
    "isAVActivity": true
  }
}
```

### Methods

These are the endpoints you can hit to do things.

#### Info
  Use these endpoints to query the current state of your Harmony Hub.

    GET /status => StatusResource
    GET /activities => {:activities => [ActivityResource, ActivityResource, ...]}

#### Control
  Use these endpoints to control your devices through your Harmony Hub.

    PUT /off => NowPlayingResource => {message: "ok"}
    POST /start_activity?activity=watch-tv => {message: "ok"}

## To Do

- [ ] Support multiple Harmony Hubs
- [ ] Support raw commands to control individual devices
